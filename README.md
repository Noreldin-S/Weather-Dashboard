# Weather-Dashboard

https://github.com/Noreldin-S/weather-dashboard




First I created the Html sheet.

Then I created an account on openweathermap.org and created an aip key.

I created my script sheet.

the first page will be html with a search bar to search for a city.
the second page made in script sheet, after you search for a city it will show you the weather for this city for 5 days and the date, humidity, wind speed, and uv index. all made by using the api on openweathermap.org no css sheet been made.

Also on the left below the search bar all cities will be stored, in case you want to go back to an old city.
